# Memeventory (WIP)
Personalized shareable meme collections

Memeventory is comprised of two applications:

1. Frontend: single page application built in Vue and TypeScript that displays data pulled from the backend API
2. Backend: Built in Go, Revel and MariaDB

In the Future: 
<br/>
Google tag management to classify images into meme categories
<br/>
Tensorflow/Keras Image classification to automatically tag images
<br/>

Memeventory's infrastructure relies on Kubernetes and will be served by GCP machines
